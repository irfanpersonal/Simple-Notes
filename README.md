# Notes

A straightforward Notes Application designed to help users get familiar with Django development. It includes extensive comments throughout the code, making it a helpful reference for future Django projects.

## Technologies Used

- [Python](https://www.python.org/): A versatile, high-level programming language known for its readability, ease of use, and wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/): A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It simplifies the creation of web applications by providing reusable components like authentication, database management, and URL routing, allowing developers to focus on building features. Known for its scalability, security, and adherence to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, Django is widely used for building both simple and complex web applications.
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/): A lightweight, serverless, self-contained SQL database engine that is widely used for embedded database applications. Unlike traditional database management systems, SQLite is fully contained within a single file, making it easy to set up and use. Itâ€™s ideal for small to medium-sized applications, development environments, and situations where simplicity, portability, and minimal configuration are key. SQLite is commonly used in mobile apps, web browsers, and other applications that need reliable, file-based storage without the overhead of a full-fledged database server.

## Setup Instructions

1st - Download the project

- -m is a flag that says I would like to run a module as a script
- venv is the built in module used to creating virtual environments
- .venv is the virtual environment name I would like to have (convention)
